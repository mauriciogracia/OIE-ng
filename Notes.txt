/ can you free hand paint over the existing layers ? (pencil, brushes) ?

- TextLayer allow :
    - "[style]" atribute should be generated but a single getter method
    - Size 
    - Color - https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=color%20picker
    - Font
    - Bold, Italic, Underlines, Strike..etc

- Export (generate the JSON from the layers)
    / New design

/ FIX Height of Vertical scrolling on layerList by using Flex
    - vertical scrolling of Layerlist on mobile is not working as expected (height of scroller contains seems too tall)

/ Improvements for all Dialogs
    X Titles should be ADD or EDIT (not both)
    / vertical size of dialog makes its use on mobile (landscape) imposible
    - Validate data of Dialog forms (numeric fields, etc)

- Allow multiple selection to allow certain operations on that selection

- Toolbar buttons
    / Settings button
        - show/save settings to user
        / layer can be dragged only when selected - setting 
    - Flip vertical/horizontal (as toolbar button)
    
    - Add tooltips to all buttons (mobile ?)

    - Show current design name 
        - on the title of the app - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34602806/how-to-change-page-title-in-angular2-router
        - somewhere else that is less complicated
        
- UNDO / REDO 
    - each action that changes the layering in anyway needs to be kept, undoing is reverting the previous stored action (opposite)
    - how many steps back ?
    - saving clears this data ?

X Export to HTML 
    X button 
    X Export as HTML (div, images, styles)
    X Layer with position transform are not exported correctly
    X Check export for layers with rotation and scale 
    X Export using actual Font attributes of each text layer

X Fix issue of hiding/showing a transformed layer 

X Decouple the rotate/scale tranform  
    X toolbar icon
    X new dialog
    X remove scale/rotate from other dialogs
    X fix scale/rotate for both type of layers

X Add/Edit TextLayer 
    X Text
    X Position
    X Layer name is the 10 characters of the text

X Add/Edit image layer 
    X Add/Change image by URL (no need to host the file)
    X Position (initial/relacote)

X Fix positioning console error of demo layers

X refactor the logic of image and text dialogs

X Fix layer name issues
    X when adding a "sample" text layer, the name is empty on the list of layers
    X allow text layers to have also a name
    X layers are being labeld "text_XX" while others "layer_XX"

X When editing a layer, dont allow position to be edited : disable the position controls

X Fix add/save buttons

X Make wider the numeric input controls

X Show tooltip on top (not below)

X Fix scrolling issue when showing tooltip and dragging

X avoid calling methods in HTML templates
    X Use observable for getLayers() list - https://angular.io/guide/observables-in-angular
    X use console.log in those functions to check how often is being used
    X check other templates/methods 
        X remove getZindex() method and its use 
        X left and top methods
        X getTransform no longer used


X When any type of layer is duplicated...
    X trying to edit is not opening 
    X exporting not exporting cloned layers
    * (instanceOf does not work on cloned )

X These Layer Operations
    X Move by dragging
    X Reorder Layers (z-index)
    X Edit Layer should be a new button, disabled until a layer is selected
    X Dragging a layer should select it from the begging(it was being selected at and of drag)
    X Clicking on a layer should select it
    X After creating a layer it should be selected 
    X Method to update Layer (if data != null UPDATE otherwise ADD)
    X Default edit position to selected layer(text/image)
    X Suggest a UNIQUE layername for image layers
    X Avoid text wrap on text layers 
    X Hide layer list when no layers present
    X Fix layer list header to show always on a single row
    X Duplicate layer (as toolbar button)

X Use Material for Dialogs 
    X implement a "generic dialog" to has the Close/OK-CANCEL and allows to specify content
    - https://material.io/components/dialogs/android#full-screen-dialog
    - https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-material-dialog/

X Layer list    
    X Selected layer should be highlighted on the LayerList 
    X "eye" button to show or hide a layer (it cannot be a toolbar icon, how do you select a hidden layer to show it ?)
    X "trash" icon to remove layer (select layer to delete and show confirmation message)
    X Slide right/left the layer list to hide it
    X items should be draggable from layer list to change order
    X Improve styling of layer dragging to match this example
        https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview

X Host it on netlify and test it - https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/angular/
    - Desktop
    - Tablet
    - Cellphone

To test it from another device
    - using netlify - https://upbeat-wiles-102f43.netlify.app/
    - using localhost
        > ng s --host 0.0.0.0
        - disable firewall / add rule 
        - connect to 192.168.1.15:4200
