    - using localhost
        > ng s --host 0.0.0.0

X Scrolling techniques (if layers are wider tan layer canvas it should scroll)
    - https://material.io/archive/guidelines/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html#

/ Layer Operations
    X Move by dragging
    X Reorder Layers (z-index)
    X Edit Layer should be a new button, disabled until a layer is selected
    X Dragging a layer should select it from the begging(it was being selected at and of drag)
    X Clicking on a layer should select it
    X After creating a layer it should be selected 
    X Method to update Layer (if data != null UPDATE otherwise ADD)
    X Default edit position to selected layer(text/image)
    X Suggest a UNIQUE layername for image layers

    X Avoid text wrap on text layers 
    X FIX Heighy Vertical scrolling on layerList by using Flex
    - vertical scrolling of Layerlist on mobile is not working as expected (height of scroller contains seems too tall)

    - can you free hand paint over the existing layers ? (pencil, brushes) ?

    / Dialogs
        X Titles should be ADD or EDIT (not both)
        / vertical size of dialog makes its use on mobile (landscape) imposible
        - Validate data of Dialog forms (numeric fields, etc)
        - Enter should trigger default blue button

    / At end of drag update layer position/transformations (movinh by dialog and then dragging causes issues)
        - if this is not solved, allow only dragging of layer (not positioning by pixels ?!)

    / Add/Edit image layer (reuse dialog for edit)
        X Add/Change image by :
            X URL (no need to host the file)
            - uploading files
        X Position (initial/relacote)
        X Scale (initial/new scale)
        / Rotate (initial/new scale)
    / Add/Edit TextLayer 
        X Text
        X Position
        X Layer name is the 10 characters of the text
        - Scale
        - Font
        - Size 
        - Color - https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=color%20picker
        - Bold, Italic, Subrayado, Strike..etc
    
    - Allow multiple selection to allow certain operations on that selection

    - Toolbar buttons
        / Settings button
            - show/save settings to user
            / layer can be dragged only when selected - setting 
        - Flip vertical/horizontal (as toolbar button)
        X Duplicate layer (as toolbar button)
        - Add tooltips to all buttons (mobile ?)
        - Export (generate the JSON from the layers)
            - what extension : OIE 
            - what format : JSON
            - where ? in the cloud ? locally 
            - Show current design name on the title of the app - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34602806/how-to-change-page-title-in-angular2-router
            - New  
                X button
                - ask for confirmation when changesArePending
                - ask for design name or only when saving ?
            - Load 
                X button
                - copy/paste file content ? 
                - file upload ?
            - Save/Export functionality
                X button 
                - as propietary format *.oie 
                - as HTML (div, images, styles)
                - as image

- UNDO / REDO 
    - each action that changes the layering in anyway needs to be kept, undoing is reverting the previous stored action (opposite)
    - how many steps back ?
    - saving clears this data ?

- Create generic confirmation dialog - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41684114/easy-way-to-make-a-confirmation-dialog-in-angular 
 
X Use Material for Dialogs 
    X implement a "generic dialog" to has the Close/OK-CANCEL and allows to specify content
    - https://material.io/components/dialogs/android#full-screen-dialog
    - https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-material-dialog/

X Layer list    
    X Selected layer should be highlighted on the LayerList 
    X "eye" button to show or hide a layer (it cannot be a toolbar icon, how do you select a hidden layer to show it ?)
    X "trash" icon to remove layer (select layer to delete and show confirmation message)
    X Slide right/left the layer list to hide it
    X items should be draggable from layer list to change order
    X Improve styling of layer dragging to match this example
        https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview

X Host it on netlify and test it - https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/angular/
